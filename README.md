# 🇵🇹 Portuguese Study Deck (European Portuguese)

This repository tracks my ongoing study of **European Portuguese** using:

- Flashcards (CSV)
- Example sentences
- Study logs (weekly and milestone-based)

It’s part of my long-term plan to **relocate to Portugal** and work in IT Support there. The goal is not just casual learning, but a structured system I can maintain over months and years.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a reusable, extensible **study deck** for European Portuguese  
- Track progress through **structured study logs and milestones**  
- Reinforce grammar and vocabulary with **CSV flashcards**  
- Practise real-world usage with **sentence examples**  
- Show consistent commitment to Portuguese as part of my relocation strategy

## 🧠 Flashcards

All flashcards are stored as **CSV files** so they can be imported into tools like Anki, Quizlet, RemNote, etc.

Located in: `flashcards/`

Current decks:

- `flashcards_past.csv`  
  - Pretérito perfeito of high-frequency verbs (ser, estar, ter, ir, poder, dizer, ver, dar, morar, nadar, viver, brincar, passar, etc.)  
  - Columns like: `Verb, Tense, Portuguese, English`

- `flashcards_present.csv`  
  - Present tense (presente do indicativo) of the same core verbs.  
  - Designed to mirror the past-tense deck for comparison.

- `flashcards_possessive_adjectives.csv`  
  - Forms like: `meu/minha`, `meus/minhas`, `nosso/nossa`, `seu/sua`, etc.  
  - With notes on **gender**, **number**, and usage.

These decks focus on:

- Core conjugations I actually use when speaking  
- Accuracy on irregular verbs  
- Building a foundation I can re-use in future decks (reflexives, preterite vs imperfect, etc.)

## ✏️ Sentence Practice

Located in: `sentences/`

- `possessive_adjectives_sentences.md`  
  - Example sentences using possessive adjectives in different persons, genders, and numbers.  
  - Helps reinforce when to use *meu/nosso/seu/teu*, etc. in context instead of just memorising forms.

The idea is to gradually add more files here for:

- Reflexive verbs  
- Prepositions in context  
- Common daily phrases  
- Conversation-focused sentence practice

## 🗓️ Study Logs

Located in: `logs/`

This repository originally used **weekly logs** to build consistency and discipline.  
As the system matured, it transitioned to **milestone-based logs** to capture meaningful progress without a fixed time commitment.

Both formats are kept to show learning evolution over time.

### Log file formats

- `YYYY-MM-week-XX.md` — early weekly study logs  
- `YYYY-milestone-<focus>.md` — milestone-based progress logs  

Examples:
- `2025-07-week-03.md`  
- `2025-milestone-conversation-confidence.md`

### Log structure

Each log follows a consistent structure:

- **Topics Studied**  
  Grammar, vocabulary, or skills worked on during that period.

- **Vocabulary Highlights**  
  Key words and phrases that came up repeatedly or felt important.

- **Common Mistakes Reviewed**  
  Typical errors in:
  - Gender and number agreement  
  - Verb conjugation  
  - Prepositions  
  - Pronouns and determiners  

- **Mini Quiz (Optional)**  
  Short recall exercises with answers (sometimes using `<details>` blocks on GitHub).

- **Reflection**  
  Honest notes on:
  - What felt hard  
  - What started to click  
  - What still needs revisiting  

- **Next Steps**  
  Clear, concrete goals for the next phase of study.

- **Date Logged**  
  Exact date to track consistency over time.

This structure turns the repo into a **self-coaching tool** rather than random notes.

## 🔁 How I Use This Repo

- **Ongoing**
  - Add new words or verbs to the appropriate CSV deck.  
  - Add or refine example sentences in `sentences/`.  
  - Note recurring mistakes or confusion points.

- **At milestones**
  - Create a new log in `logs/` to document meaningful progress.  
  - Review previous logs to identify patterns and long-term improvements.

- **Over time**
  - Track how focus shifts (verbs → adjectives → prepositions → conversation).  
  - Identify recurring weaknesses (e.g. gender agreement, prepositions with *ir*).  
  - Maintain a clear written record that supports my relocation narrative when speaking with Portuguese employers.

## 🌍 Why This Matters for My Portugal Plan

This repo is part of my broader **Portugal IT Career Transition**:

- Shows consistent, structured commitment to learning European Portuguese  
- Aligns with my goal of working in **IT Support in Portugal**  
- Provides evidence I can:
  - self-organise  
  - build systems for learning  
  - stick to long-term goals  

Together with my IT support labs and ticket simulations, this helps tell a clear story:

> “I’m not just moving to Portugal for the weather. I’m actively preparing for the language, culture, and workplace.”

## 📌 Future Plans

Planned expansions:

- New flashcard sets:
  - Imperfect vs preterite  
  - Reflexive verbs  
  - Time expressions and connectors  

- More sentence packs:
  - Talking about work and IT  
  - Customer service and support scenarios  
  - Daily life conversations  

- More detailed milestone logs as I approach higher levels (B1, B2)
