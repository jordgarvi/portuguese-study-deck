# 🇵🇹 Portuguese Study Deck (European Portuguese)

This repository tracks my ongoing study of **European Portuguese** using:

- Flashcards (CSV)
- Example sentences
- Weekly study logs

It’s part of my long-term plan to **relocate to Portugal** and work in IT Support there. The goal is not just casual learning, but a structured system I can maintain over months and years.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a reusable, extensible **study deck** for European Portuguese  
- Track progress through **weekly logs**  
- Reinforce grammar and vocabulary with **CSV flashcards**  
- Practise real-world usage with **sentence examples**  
- Show consistent commitment to Portuguese as part of my relocation strategy

## 🧠 Flashcards

All flashcards are stored as **CSV files** so they can be imported into tools like Anki, Quizlet, RemNote, etc.

Located in: `flashcards/`

Current decks:

- `flashcards_past.csv`  
  - Pretérito perfeito of high-frequency verbs (ser, estar, ter, ir, poder, dizer, ver, dar, morar, nadar, viver, brincar, passar, etc.)
  - Columns like: `Verb, Tense, Portuguese, English`

- `flashcards_present.csv`  
  - Present tense (presente do indicativo) of the same core verbs.
  - Designed to mirror the past-tense deck for comparison.

- `flashcards_possessive_adjectives.csv`  
  - Forms like: `meu/minha`, `meus/minhas`, `nosso/nossa`, `seu/sua`, etc.
  - With notes on **gender**, **number**, and usage.

These decks focus on:

- Core conjugations I actually use when speaking  
- Accuracy on irregular verbs  
- Building a foundation I can re-use in future decks (reflexives, preterite vs imperfect, etc.)

## ✏️ Sentence Practice

Located in: `sentences/`

- `possessive_adjectives_sentences.md`  
  - Example sentences using possessive adjectives in different persons, genders, and numbers.
  - Helps reinforce when to use *meu/nosso/seu/teu*, etc. in context instead of just memorising forms.

The idea is to gradually add more files here for:

- Reflexive verbs  
- Prepositions in context  
- Common daily phrases  
- “Week in review” sentence exercises

## 🗓️ Weekly Study Logs

Located in: `logs/`  

Each file follows the format:  

- `YYYY-MM-week-XX.md`

For example:

- `2025-07-week-01.md`  
- `2025-07-week-02.md`  
- `2025-07-week-03.md`  
- `2025-07-week-04.md`  
- `2025-08-week-05.md`

Each log follows a consistent structure:

- **Topics Studied**  
  What grammar, vocabulary, or skills I focused on that week (e.g. reflexive verbs, adjectives, prepositions, personality descriptions).

- **Vocabulary Highlights**  
  A curated list of key words and phrases that came up repeatedly or felt important.

- **Common Mistakes Reviewed**  
  Typical errors in:
  - Gender and number agreement  
  - Verb conjugation  
  - Prepositions  
  - Pronouns and determiners  

- **Mini Quiz (Optional)**  
  A short recall activity with answers (sometimes using `<details>` blocks when viewed on GitHub).

- **Reflection**  
  Honest notes about:
  - What felt hard  
  - What started to “click”  
  - What needs revisiting  

- **Next Steps**  
  Concrete goals for the following week – e.g.:
  - “Practise saber vs conhecer”  
  - “Add 10 new adjectives to flashcards”  
  - “Do a listening exercise and transcribe 5 sentences”

- **Date Logged**  
  Exact date so I can see my consistency over time.

This structure turns the repo into a **self-coaching tool** rather than random notes.

## 🔁 How I Use This Repo

- **During the week**
  - Add new words/verbs to the appropriate CSV deck.
  - Add or adjust example sentences in `sentences/`.
  - Make rough notes on mistakes and confusion points.

- **End of the week**
  - Create a new log in `logs/` (copy the previous one as a template).
  - Fill in:
    - Topics Studied  
    - Vocabulary Highlights  
    - Common Mistakes  
    - Reflection  
    - Next Steps  
  - Review the previous week’s “Next Steps” and tick off what I actually did.

- **Over time**
  - Track how my focus changes (verbs → adjectives → prepositions → conversation).
  - Spot recurring weaknesses (e.g. gender agreement, prepositions with verbs like *ir*).
  - Keep a written record that supports my relocation story when talking to Portuguese employers.

## 🌍 Why This Matters for My Portugal Plan

This repo is part of my broader **Portugal IT Career Transition**:

- Shows consistent, structured commitment to learning European Portuguese
