# Portuguese Study Log – Milestone: Conversation Confidence

## Milestone Focus
Developing confidence in spoken European Portuguese by prioritising communication, flow, and real conversation with real people.

---

## Topics Studied
- Responding to common conversational questions with full sentences.
- Speaking more freely without stopping to mentally conjugate every verb.
- Reading sentences and short paragraphs aloud to improve rhythm and pronunciation.
- Reinforcing present tense and frequently used past forms in conversation.
- Becoming more comfortable rephrasing ideas when vocabulary is missing.

---

## What Changed
- Increased confidence answering personal and routine questions in Portuguese.
- Less hesitation when speaking, even when unsure about grammar.
- Improved awareness of pronunciation, especially nasal sounds and stress.
- Greater ability to keep a conversation going instead of freezing or switching to English.
- Shift from “trying to be correct” to “trying to be understood”.

## Examples (Conversation in Practice)
- *Moro no Reino Unido, mas quero mudar-me para Portugal.*  
- *Trabalho em IT Support e estou a aprender português todos os dias.*  
- *Às vezes fico nervoso a falar, mas continuo a tentar.*  

These sentences reflect realistic answers I can reuse and adapt in real conversations.

---

## Common Difficulties Still Present
- Pausing when searching for less familiar vocabulary.
- Mixing present and past tenses when speaking quickly.
- Occasional uncertainty with prepositions and sentence order.
- Losing confidence when I notice small mistakes mid-sentence.
